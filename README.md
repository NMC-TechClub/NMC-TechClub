I am Ashish Yesale  from India . Thanks for having me. Currently I am pursuing degree of B.Tech CSE at Nanasaheb Mahadik College of Engineering, Peth .(i.e. 2nd CSE year student ).
I have been introduced to the world of programming since 2018 . Where I have learned Python , Django ,Database Connectivity and SQL  , HTML , CSS , JavaScript and  C all these languages.

In covid-19 period I started taking more interest and giving my time to work with new projects and thanks to GitHub to provide open-source environment where I can study others projects too and contribute to them .
Now , regarding our community before this my college did't had any club or extra activity that have been participated in GitHub before and we only have GDSE community over here which can be found here " https://bit.ly/nmcoegdse " .
Similar to GDSE I was wondering about having new group at our college though I am my colleagues have created a new club at "Tech Club" at our college which has been created 1 week ago .
within the guidance of our teachers . 

My role at tech Club is as a ' Tech-Leader ' to guide my friends and to introduce new Club at our college . Tough we have so many difficulties creating this Club web finally have achieved it and this was the first achievement that we had .
